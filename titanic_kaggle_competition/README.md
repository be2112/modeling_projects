## Prerequisites

* miniconda3-4.3.30
  * You can install Miniconda from https://conda.io/miniconda.html
  * If you would like to manage multiple Python versions on your machine at once, I recommend using pyenv (https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)



## Folder Structure

The folder structure follows the suggestions made by William Stafford Noble in *A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects*.

Noble, William Stafford. “A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects.” *PLoS Computational Biology*, vol. 5, no. 7, 2009, doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424.
